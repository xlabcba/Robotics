# Kinematics

## Introduction
This folder contains solutions to some robotics basic problems, which is used to practice robotics kinematics and get familiar with Robotics Tool Box (RTB).

## Folder Structure

* **[homework1.pdf](https://github.com/xlabcba/Robotics/blob/master/Kinematics/homework1.pdf)** - Description of 3 writing questions.
* **[CS5335_HW1_LiXie.pdf](https://github.com/xlabcba/Robotics/blob/master/Kinematics/CS5335_HW1_LiXie.pdf)** - Solutions to 3 transformation calculations practice.
* **[hw1.m](https://github.com/xlabcba/Robotics/blob/master/Kinematics/hw1.m)** - Function to run solution to each question by giving corresponding question number.
* **[Q1.m](https://github.com/xlabcba/Robotics/tree/master/Kinematics/Q1.m)** & **[Q2.m](https://github.com/xlabcba/Robotics/tree/master/Kinematics/Q2.m)** & **[Q3.m](https://github.com/xlabcba/Robotics/tree/master/Kinematics/Q3.m)** - Solutions to 3 kinematic implementation by RTB.

## Run Instruction:
